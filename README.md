# User Manual

The user will be taken to a startup menu where they will be able to pick a game. 
To pick a game the user must input the number of the game. At this point the only option is Roulette. 
Choosing any other option will shut down the program.

Once the Roulette game is chosen, the user will be able to pick on of three options, Odd or Even, Red or Black, and Number Picker. 
The player will pick one of the three games through their provided abbreviations. 

The first game, Odd or Even, will play as a typical two choice game where the generator can end on an odd or even number, or on 0 or 00. 
The system will take a single bet and if the bet is won, the player will gain double what they bet.

The second game, Red or Black, will play out in a similar fashion. 
The player will be able to bet on red or black tiles and the generator will land on red, black, or green. 
If the player wins the bet they will gain double what they initially bet.

The last game is Number Picker. 
In this game, the player will choose 1 to 2 numbers out of 1-36, 0, or 00. 
If 1 of the numbers bet on is one of the winning numbers the player will gain 35 times the amount bet. 

After each round, the player will be able to decide if they wish to continue betting. 
The program will shut down after the player loses all their earnings regardless.
